A period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nA very cold airmass combined with light winds will generate extreme wind chill values tonight through Saturday morning.\n\nWhile anyone who isn't dressed warmly is at risk in cold weather conditions, some are at greater risk than others for frost bite and hypothermia:\n - homeless people\n - outdoor workers\n - people living in homes that are poorly insulated (with no heat or no power)\n - people with certain medical conditions such as diabetes, peripheral neuropathy and diseases affecting the blood vessels, people taking certain medications including beta-blockers\n - winter sport enthusiasts\n - people who consume excess alcohol\n - infants and \n - seniors.\n\nWear appropriate clothing. \n - Always wear clothing appropriate for the weather. Synthetic and wool fabrics provide better insulation. Some synthetic fabrics are designed to keep perspiration away from your body which keep you dry and further reduce your risk. \n - Dress in layers with a wind resistant outer layer. You can remove layers if you get too warm (before you start sweating) or add a layer if you get cold. \n - Wear warm socks, gloves, a hat and scarf in cold weather. Be sure to cover your nose to protect it. \n - If you get wet, change into dry clothing as soon as possible. You lose heat faster when you're wet.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nEnvironment Canada meteorologists will update alerts as required.

Vous pouvez toujours retirer ou ajouter une couche selon que vous avez trop chaud (avant de commencer à transpirer) ou que vous avez froid. \n - Portez des chaussettes chaudes, des gants, un chapeau et un foulard par temps froid. N'oubliez pas de couvrir votre nez. \n - Si vous êtes mouillé, changez-vous dès que possible, car vous perdrez rapidement de la chaleur autrement.\n\nUn avertissement de froid extrême est émis lorsque le refroidissement éolien ou les températures très froides présentent un danger élevé pour la santé (engelure, hypothermie, etc.).\n\nLes météorologistes d'Environnement Canada mettront les alertes à jour au besoin. Veuillez vous informer auprès des médias ou de Radiométéo pour obtenir les mises à jour. Pour signaler du temps violent, composez le 1-800-239-0484 ou envoyez un courriel à storm@ec.gc.ca ou envoyer des gazouillis à #ABMétéo.<br>Expires: 2015-01-31T20:15:00-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environnement Canada, 2015-01-31T04:15:00-00:00, 2.49.0.1.124.d3947dc5.2015<br>Area: m.r. de Wood Buffalo près de Fitzgerald et de la crique La Butte, m.r. de Wood Buffalo près de Clausen's Landing et Chipewyan 201FG, m.r. de Wood Buffalo près des rés. ind.

épisode pendant lequel le refroidissement éolien sera très élevé est prévu.\n\nLa combinaison d'une masse d'air arctique et de vents légers à modérés produira un refroidissement éolien aussi froid que -40 sur le centre nord du Québec cette nuit.  Ce froid se propagera vers les régions plus au sud et à l'est dans la journée de samedi pour occasionner un refroidissement éolien entre -38 et -50 à partir de samedi soir.\n\nUn avertissement de froid extrême est émis lorsque le refroidissement éolien ou les températures très froides présentent un danger élevé pour la santé (engelure, hypothermie, etc.).\n\nLes météorologistes d'Environnement Canada mettront les alertes à jour au besoin. Veuillez vous informer auprès des médias ou de Radiométéo pour obtenir les mises à jour.

Un système météorologique au large de Cape Cod se déplace vers les Maritimes samedi pour atteindre Terre-Neuve dimanche. Dans le sillage de cette tempête, les vents forts se lèveront. La combinaison de la neige fraîchement tombée et des vents causera de la poudrerie généralisée réduisant fortement la visibilité sur ces régions surtout à partir de samedi soir.\n\nOn peut s'attendre à des conditions routières dangereuses en raison de la visibilité réduite. Adaptez votre conduite aux conditions routières changeantes.\n\nUn avis de poudrerie est émis lorsque l'on prévoit que les vents produiront de la poudrerie réduisant la visibilité à 800 mètres ou moins durant au moins 3 heures.\n\nLes météorologistes d'Environnement Canada mettront les alertes à jour au besoin.

Un épisode pendant lequel le refroidissement éolien sera très élevé est prévu.\n\nLa combinaison d'une masse d'air glacial combiné à des vents forts produira un refroidissement éolien aussi froid que -55 sur cette région du Nunavik jusqu'à samedi matin.\n\nSurveillez l'apparition des symptômes et les signes associés au froid, notamment :\n - appareil respiratoire : essoufflement, respiration sifflante et toux\n - système cardiovasculaire : douleurs thoraciques, arythmie\n - appareil circulatoire : décoloration des doigts et des orteils, douleur, engourdissement et sensation de picotement dans les extrémités\n - muscles : douleur, raideur, enflure, perte de mobilité, faiblesse \n - peau : démangeaisons, pâleur.\nSi vous souffrez de ces symptômes et que vous êtes exposé au froid, rendez-vous à l'intérieur et commencez à vous réchauffer.\n\nPortez des vêtements appropriés. \n - Portez toujours des vêtements adaptés au temps qu'il fait. Les tissus synthétiques et la laine fournissent une meilleure isolation. Certains tissus synthétiques sont conçus pour éloigner la transpiration du corps, ce qui vous garde au sec et réduit davantage les risques. \n - Habillez-vous de plusieurs couches de vêtements, dont une couche extérieure étanche au vent. Vous pouvez toujours retirer ou ajouter une couche selon que vous avez trop chaud (avant de commencer à transpirer) ou que vous avez froid. \n - Portez des chaussettes chaudes, des gants, un chapeau et un foulard par temps froid. N'oubliez pas de couvrir votre nez. \n - Si vous êtes mouillé, changez-vous dès que possible, car vous perdrez rapidement de la chaleur autrement.\n\nUn avertissement de froid extrême est émis lorsque le refroidissement éolien ou les températures très froides présentent un danger élevé pour la santé (engelure, hypothermie, etc.).\n\nLes météorologistes d'Environnement Canada mettront les alertes à jour au besoin.

A winter storm will impact New Brunswick tonight into Saturday. Periods of light snow over northwest New Brunswick will continue tonight and slowly spread east. On Saturday snow will spread across the entire province with amounts near 15 cm possible by Saturday night.  Also winds will increase during the day and give some areas of blowing snow causing reduced visibilities. Winter storm warnings have been issued for the remainder of the province.\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays. Public Safety Canada encourages everyone to make an emergency plan and get an emergency kit with drinking water, food, medicine, a first-aid kit and a flashlight.\n\nWinter Storm Watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nEnvironment Canada meteorologists will update alerts as required.

La faible neige passagère sur le nord-ouest du Nouveau-Brunswick continuera ce soir et cette nuit, puis se propagera et lentement vers l'est. Samedi, la neige envahira l'ensemble de la province, donnant une accumulation possible de près de 15 cm d'ici là nuit de samedi à dimanche.

Des avertissements de tempête hivernale sont en vigueur pour le reste de la province.\n\nLa visibilité peut être soudainement réduite par moments dans la neige forte. Les mauvaises conditions météorologiques pourraient entraîner des retards liés aux transports. Sécurité publique Canada encourage les gens à préparer des plans d'urgence et à se munir de trousses d'urgence contenant de l'eau potable, de la nourriture, des médicaments, une trousse de premiers soins et une lampe de poche.\n\nUne veille de tempête hivernale est émise lorsque l'on prévoit plusieurs conditions de mauvais temps hivernal simultanément.\n\nLes météorologistes d'Environnement Canada mettront les alertes à jour au besoin.

The heavy snow will taper to periods of light snow over western New Brunswick Saturday afternoon. Snowfall amounts of 20 to 35 centimetres are forecast across the region with the heaviest amounts falling Saturday morning.\n\nConsider postponing non-essential travel until conditions improve. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions.

hivernales dangereuses.\n\nUne tempête hivernale touchera le Nouveau-Brunswick ce soir, cette nuit et samedi. Les averses de neige se changeront en neige parfois forte vers minuit sur les secteurs sud-ouest de la province et se propageront vers le nord au cours de la nuit. Des vents forts se lèveront ce soir, cette nuit ou samedi et occasionneront probablement de la poudrerie réduisant la visibilité. La neige forte diminuera d'intensité pour devenir de la faible neige passagère sur l'ouest du Nouveau-Brunswick samedi après-midi. On prévoit une accumulation de neige de 20 à 35 centimètres sur la région et l'accumulation la plus forte se produira samedi matin.\n\nÉvaluez la possibilité de retarder tout déplacement non essentiel jusqu'à ce que les conditions s'améliorent. Les surfaces comme les routes, les rues, les trottoirs et les terrains de stationnement peuvent devenir difficiles à sillonner en raison de l'accumulation de neige. Soyez prêt à composer avec des conditions routières changeantes qui se détériorent rapidement. Faites preuve de prudence lorsque vous marchez ou conduisez dans les secteurs touchés.\n\nUn avertissement de tempête hivernale est émis lorsque l'on prévoit plusieurs conditions de mauvais temps hivernal simultanément.\n\nLes météorologistes d'Environnement Canada mettront les alertes à jour au besoin. Demeurez informé en écoutant Radiométéo ou en consultant les médias. Pour signaler du temps violent, vous pouvez envoyer un courriel à weatherASPC@ec.gc.ca ou un gazouillis à #NBMétéo.<br>Expires: 2015-01-31T17:56:00-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environnement

overnight and through Saturday morning.\n\nWhile anyone who isn't dressed warmly is at risk in cold weather conditions, some are at greater risk than others for frost bite and hypothermia:\n - homeless people\n - outdoor workers\n - people living in homes that are poorly insulated (with no heat or no power)\n - people with certain medical conditions such as diabetes, peripheral neuropathy and diseases affecting the blood vessels, people taking certain medications including beta-blockers\n - winter sport enthusiasts\n - people who consume excess alcohol\n - infants and \n - seniors.\n\nWear appropriate clothing. \n - Always wear clothing appropriate for the weather. Synthetic and wool fabrics provide better insulation. Some synthetic fabrics are designed to keep perspiration away from your body which keep you dry and further reduce your risk. \n - Dress in layers with a wind resistant outer layer. You can remove layers if you get too warm (before you start sweating) or add a layer if you get cold. \n - Wear warm socks, gloves, a hat and scarf in cold weather. Be sure to cover your nose to protect it. \n - If you get wet, change into dry clothing as soon as possible. You lose heat faster when you're wet.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nEnvironment Canada meteorologists will update alerts as required. Please continue to monitor your local media or Weatheradio for further updates. If you would like to report severe weather, you can call 1-800-239-0484 or send an email to storm@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports to #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2015-01-31T14:21:00-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2015-01-30T22:21:00-00:00, 2.49.0.1.124.308e55f7.2015<br>Area: R.M. of Wood Buffalo near Clausen's Landing and Chipewyan 201FG, R.M. of Wood Buffalo near Old Fort Chipewyan 201 and 201ABCDE, Wood Buffalo Nat.

A period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nThe combination of brisk northwest winds and temperatures falling to minus 35C will produce extreme wind chills near -45 to-50 tonight. Weather conditions will improve towards noon Saturday.\n\nWhile anyone who isn't dressed warmly is at risk in cold weather conditions, some are at greater risk than others for frost bite and hypothermia:\n - homeless people\n - outdoor workers\n - people living in homes that are poorly insulated (with no heat or no power)\n - people with certain medical conditions such as diabetes, peripheral neuropathy and diseases affecting the blood vessels, people taking certain medications including beta-blockers\n - winter sport enthusiasts\n - people who consume excess alcohol\n - infants and \n - seniors.\n\nWear appropriate clothing. \n - Always wear clothing appropriate for the weather. Synthetic and wool fabrics provide better insulation. Some synthetic fabrics are designed to keep perspiration away from your body which keep you dry and further reduce your risk. \n - Dress in layers with a wind resistant outer layer. You can remove layers if you get too warm (before you start sweating) or add a layer if you get cold. \n - Wear warm socks, gloves, a hat and scarf in cold weather. Be sure to cover your nose to protect it. \n - If you get wet, change into dry clothing as soon as possible. You lose heat faster when you're wet.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nEnvironment Canada meteorologists will update alerts as required. Please continue to monitor your local media or Weatheradio for further updates.

Extreme wind chill values of minus 45 to minus 50 are expected tonight into Saturday morning, and again Saturday night into Sunday morning.\n\nWear appropriate clothing. \n - Always wear clothing appropriate for the weather. Synthetic and wool fabrics provide better insulation. Some synthetic fabrics are designed to keep perspiration away from your body which keep you dry and further reduce your risk. \n - Dress in layers with a wind resistant outer layer. You can remove layers if you get too warm (before you start sweating) or add a layer if you get cold. \n - Wear warm socks, gloves, a hat and scarf in cold weather. Be sure to cover your nose to protect it. \n - If you get wet, change into dry clothing as soon as possible. You lose heat faster when you're wet.\n\nProtect yourself. \n - On sunny days wear sun glasses, lip balm and sunscreen to protect your skin from UV and keep it moisturized to help prevent windburn. \n - Wear a face mask and goggles if you are participating in winter activities such as skiing, snowmobiling and skating to protect your face from frostbite and windburn. \n - Keep moving (especially your hands and feet) to keep your blood flowing and maintain your body heat. \n - Drink enough fluids, but avoid very cold drinks and consume warm meals regularly.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nEnvironment Canada meteorologists will update alerts as required, so stay tuned to your local media or Weatheradio.

Visibilité parfois réduite dans la poudrerie par endroits et bandes\nD'averses de neige causées par l'effet de lac.\n\nDes bandes d'averses de neige arrivent du lac Huron sud ce soir sous\nL'effet de forts vents d'air arctique soufflant en rafales du\nNord-ouest. Alors que les accumulations de neige seront probablement\nLimitées à 5 cm ou moins, la visibilité réduite par moments sous les\nBrèves poussées de neige plus forte et dans la poudrerie par endroits\nOccasionnera de mauvaises conditions de conduite hivernale jusqu'à ce\nSoir. Les automobilistes doivent donc faire preuve de prudence et\nPrévoir plus de temps pour se rendre à destination.\n\n\n\nLes averses de neige causées par l'effet de lac diminueront lentement\nD'intensité plus tard ce soir, permettant aux conditions routières de\nS'améliorer lentement.\n\n\n\nSurveillez les plus récentes prévisions et les avertissements\nD'Environnement Canada à

A period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nThe combination of an Arctic air mass and moderate to light winds will give wind chill values as cold as -40 in North Central Quebec overnight tonight.  These frigid conditions will spread toward regions farther south and farther east during the day Saturday, giving wind chill values between -38 and -50 beginning Saturday evening.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nEnvironment Canada meteorologists will update alerts as required.
